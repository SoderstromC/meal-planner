# Final Project Technigo Bootcamp
Everyone needs to eat but planning meals and shopping for ingredients takes time and energy. We believe that we can improve our users’ lives by providing a meal planner app.

By using this app our users: 

- Don’t have to spend unnecessary time figuring out what to eat (time-saving)
- Can plan for one trip to the grocery store instead of daily (efficient)
- Will only buy ingredients that they know will be used (less food waste).
- Eat tasty and varied food (health and joy)
- Have more time over to enjoy a good meal (quality time)

# Foodify: Your meal planner
