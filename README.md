# Final Project Technigo Bootcamp
Everyone needs to eat but planning meals and shopping for ingredients takes time and energy. We believe that we can improve our users’ lives by providing a meal planner app.

By using this app our users: 

- Don’t have to spend unnecessary time figuring out what to eat (time-saving)
- Can plan for one trip to the grocery store instead of daily (efficient)
- Will only buy ingredients that they know will be used (less food waste).
- Eat tasty and varied food (health and joy)
- Have more time over to enjoy a good meal (quality time)

# Foodify: Your meal planner

## If we had more time
- Create logic for "heart button" to be constantly filled in when you save a recipe, not only when clicked
- Use middleware for login and authentication, not prioritised as we are not handling any sensitive user info, only recipe info
- Refactor Single Recipe to one component instead of three
- Research and use design library 
- Refactor fetch logic in order to access and map out data more easily
- Changed API endpoint for Recipe List to one that is more focused on main courses (lunch, dinner)
- Add search and filter logic to Recipe List
- Add calendar view for more extensive planning
- Styling, be more rigid about mobile first and use CSS variables
